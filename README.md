# Smartgeo-scout-
SmartGeo Scout is an AI-powered offline tool that uses geospatial data (maps, satellite imagery, soil data) to diagnose land issues, guide sustainable agriculture, and empower communities — especially in remote, underserved regions.
# 🛰️ SmartGeo Scout – AI-Powered Offline Geospatial Diagnostics

> "Geospatial intelligence for land, farms, and peace – even where the internet doesn’t reach."

## 🌍 Project Overview

**SmartGeo Scout** is a portable, AI-powered, offline tool designed to help local farmers, traditional authorities, and rural governments make smart decisions using geospatial data.

From identifying soil quality and crop suitability to mapping erosion zones or ancestral boundaries, SmartGeo Scout uses machine learning and satellite data to bring smart land management to the offline world.

## 💡 Problem It Solves

- 🌱 Farmers don’t know the best crops for their soil
- 🗺️ Disputes arise over land boundaries due to lack of mapped data
- 📶 Remote communities don’t have stable internet for cloud GIS tools
- 🌧️ Erosion and deforestation risks are poorly understood in villages

---

## 🔧 Key Features

- 🛰️ Offline land classification (NDVI + terrain + soil AI model)
- 🧠 Smart crop recommendation system based on soil and slope
- 📍 Mapping of ancestral + administrative land boundaries
- 🌊 Erosion and flood risk prediction using DEM and slope analysis
- 🗣️ Local language interface (supports Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba, etc.)
